**Unit Tests**
Unit tests focus on the smallest parts of your app in isolation, typically your domain layer's use cases and entities, and data layer's data sources and repositories.

domain/use_cases/: Test each use case independently, ensuring that it performs the correct actions and handles errors correctly. Mock out repository interfaces.
domain/entities/: If your entities contain logic, such as data validation or transformation, write tests for these scenarios.
data/data_sources/: Mock external data sources and test how your app reacts to different responses.
data/repositories/: Test the interaction between repositories and data sources, and that they correctly process the data sources' data.

**Widget Tests**
Widget tests verify the UI. They include pages and individual widgets.

pages/: Test pages in isolation, ensuring they handle user inputs and state changes correctly.
widgets/: Test individual widgets, particularly those that are reused throughout your app.

**Integration Tests**
Integration tests verify that multiple parts of your app work together as expected.

cubits/: Test how your cubits handle sequences of events and emit states.
pages/: Test the complete functionality of pages, including navigation and interaction with cubits.
Mocks
Mock classes should mirror the structure of the elements they're mocking.

domain/: Mocks for domain interfaces like repositories.
data/: Mocks for data sources and possibly data models if they involve any logic.
presentation/: Mocks for cubits, page controllers, and any other logic within the presentation layer.
Helpers
For common testing functionality, such as creating a mock environment or shared setup code.

test_helpers.dart: Common functions or classes used across different tests.
Test File Naming
Naming your test files consistently will make it easier to navigate your tests:

For unit testing a class, name the test file after the class: class_name_test.dart.
For widget testing a widget, the convention is: widget_name_test.dart.
For integration testing a process or workflow, describe the workflow: login_flow_test.dart.
Example of a Test File Layout for a Use Case:

// File path: test/unit/domain/use_cases/sign_in_with_google_use_case_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
import 'package:project_kepler/domain/use_cases/sign_in_with_google_use_case.dart';
import '../../../mocks/domain/repositories/mock_user_repository.dart';
import '../../../mocks/data/mock_firebase_auth.dart';
import '../../../mocks/data/mock_google_sign_in.dart';

void main() {
  group('SignInWithGoogleUseCase', () {
    // Define your mock classes
    late MockFirebaseAuth mockFirebaseAuth;
    late MockGoogleSignIn mockGoogleSignIn;
    late MockUserRepository mockUserRepository;
    late SignInWithGoogleUseCase useCase;

    setUp(() {
      // Initialize your mock classes
      mockFirebaseAuth = MockFirebaseAuth();
      mockGoogleSignIn = MockGoogleSignIn();
      mockUserRepository = MockUserRepository();
      useCase = SignInWithGoogleUseCase(
        firebaseAuth: mockFirebaseAuth,
        googleSignIn: mockGoogleSignIn,
        userRepository: mockUserRepository,
      );
    });

    // Define your test cases
    test('Should sign in user with Google', () async {
      // Use mock classes in your tests
    });

    // More tests...
  });
}
By following this structure, you maintain the separation of concerns that Clean Architecture enforces and ensure that your tests are as maintainable and navigable as your production code. Remember to make your tests readable and treat them as living documentation for your application.
